<h3>Shutting Down</h3>
<br/>
<b>As of November 4th, 2022, I have unfortunately decided to decommission my Tor relays.</b>  
<br/><br/>
While running Tor relays isn't too difficult for someone with the knowledge and money, it does require a fair bit of regular maintenance for which I wish I had the time. Tor relays are not simply set-and-forget, and I fear that running unmaintained relays would do the network more harm than good. With the increased volume of relays run by other kind and dedicated volunteers (who can do a much better job than me), I'm in a fortunate position in which it is less critical for me to run my relays.  
<br/><br/>
Additionally, my hosting bills, budget, and financial priorities have changed. With major life changes possibly on the horizon, I need to save as much money as possible in preparation for them. While running Tor relays was absolutely a worthwhile effort in terms of both time and money, I need to put my family first.

This list is no longer supported and the user-agent has already been blocked by torproject. (output are 0b files)

So I decided to do this job via github workflow.
